= Retort

rtorrent xmlrpc wrapper written in ruby (1.9). Designed to decouple the
xmlrpc interface from the underlying ruby objects.

== Basic usage

Update your Gemfile with this and do a bundle install:

  gem 'retort'

To get a list of all torrents:

  require 'retort'
  torrents  = Retort::Torrent.all
  torrent   = torrents.first

  files     = torrent.files
  file      = files.first

  file.set_priority(Retort::File::PRIORITY_HIGH) # sets the priority
  torrent.commit_priorities # this is supposed to be an expensive call
